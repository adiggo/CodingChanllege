These two problem is solved by using Java language, and the build tool is using Maven.
Make sure you have installed Maven and JVM in your laptop to run my codes. To install maven in Mac,
simply type : brew install maven (make sure you have installed homebrew). For other platform 
to install maven, go to http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi for more information.

To run the test, run:
cd Zillow
mvn test

Then after a little time, the results shows. 
I have also included a Solution.pdf file which explains the algorithm to solve these two problem. Also give some explanation to the test case.
